Steps to run the application as a whole --
1. From 'Command Prompt' or 'Terminal', run 'python main.py' to start the application.
2. When prompted,
	- Enter '1' to run code that satisfies Task 1
	- Enter '2' to run code that satisfies Task 2
	- Enter '3' to run code that satisfies Task 3
	- Enter '4' to exit the application
	- Any other inputs will throw an 'Invalid choice' message
3. Application will keep prompting user for a new choice until input '4' is entered.

Steps to run the application by task --
Task 1:
1. Uncomment line 124 from 'task1.py' and save
2. From 'Command Prompt' or 'Terminal', run 'python task1.py'

Task 2:
1. Uncomment line 136 from 'task2.py' and save
2. From 'Command Prompt' or 'Terminal', run 'python task2.py'

Task 3:
1. Uncomment line 162 from 'task3.py' and save
2. From 'Command Prompt' or 'Terminal', run 'python task3.py'

Notes --
For Task 3, a new json file ('Goal.json') was created to store the h values of each node. h value here represents the straight line distance from that node to the goal node (node 50).
The code for now the json file was created and how the h values were calculated can be found in 'task3.py'.
