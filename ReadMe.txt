Steps to run all 3 tasks:
1. From 'Command Prompt' or 'Terminal', run 'main.java' to run the application
2. Application will print the output for all 3 tasks

Steps to run the application by task:
Task 1:
- Comment out Tasks 2 and 3 - lines 95-103

Task 2:
- Comment out Tasks 1 and 3 - lines 90-93, 100-103

Task 3:
- Comment out Tasks 1 and 2 - lines 90-98

Notes:
- Graph.java is the graph class
- Relevant algorithms for each task:
  - Task 1: parta.java
  - Task 2: partb.java
  - Task 3: partc.java
